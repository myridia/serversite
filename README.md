# serversite
Basic static HTLM Website to present a Server

## Usage
We have many servers online what are performing public services like a Mail Transfer Agent delivery, in short called MTA.
Often other Companies or Institution require us to identify those Server, so we create a basic HTML Website to show under the main server Domain
Example: https://grallator.com

## What we show.
* Main Services with entrance
* Legal Info
